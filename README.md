# Memoize

### Our Mission
Text messaging has become one of our most widely used forms of communication. Such a large quantity of messages are sent and received everyday, but few are saved and remembered. Our mission statement is to counteract the void digital communication has brought upon us by allowing users to "journal" and save their meaningful digital moments through image-to-text recognition and categorization.
